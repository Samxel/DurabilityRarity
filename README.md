**Not all gear is created equal.**

Durability Rarity introduces a configurable rarity system that adds randomized durability tiers to every crafted or discovered tool, weapon, or armor. Each tier affects the item’s durability — from brittle to nearly unbreakable — adding variety, challenge, and reward to the way you gear up.

## 🎲 Rarity Tiers & Chances

| Rarity Name | Color        | Multiplier | Chance |
| :----------: | :-----------: | :----------: | :----: |
|    Broken    |   Dark Gray   |     x0.3     |  15%   |
|   Damaged    |     Gray      |     x0.6     |  20%   |
|    Common    |     White     |     x1.0     |  30%   |
|     Rare     |     Aqua      |     x1.3     |  20%   |
|     Epic     | Light Purple |     x1.6     |  10%   |
|  Legendary   |     Gold      |     x1.9     |   5%   |

Each time you craft an item, open a loot chest, or claim a reward from a structure, the item receives a random rarity — directly affecting its durability. But only if you put it into your Inventory.
